# 📄 Cover Letter Generator
A small Python project with one mission: save me from writing cover letters at 2 AM.  
It takes my resume highlights, mixes them with a job description, asks Gemini nicely,  
and spits out a clean PDF that sounds way more polished than I do on a Monday morning.

## ✨ What This Thing Does
- Reads my resume highlights (the bragging part)  
- Reads the company description (the begging part)  
- Asks Gemini to combine them into a professional cover letter  
- Wraps the whole thing into a neat PDF  
- Lets me pretend I’m productive and organized

## 🧠 Why I Built It
Because writing cover letters is like doing taxes:  
you know you have to do it, but you’d rather do literally anything else.  
So I automated it. Problem solved.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside
- `CLetter.py` — talks to Gemini and generates the text  
- `SPDF.py` — handles PDF formatting so the letter doesn’t look chaotic  
- `main.py` — the pipeline that glues everything together  
- `cover_letter.pdf` — proof that it actually works

## 🚀 How to Use It
Put your resume highlights in the script.  
Paste the job description.  
Run the file.  
Boom — instant cover letter, no emotional damage.

## 🎯 Who This Is For
- People applying to too many jobs  
- People who hate writing cover letters  
- People who love Python a little too much  
- Me. Mostly me.

## 😄 Final Thoughts
This project won’t guarantee you a job,  
but it *will* guarantee you spend less time staring at a blank page  
wondering why every job wants “excellent communication skills.”
