# 📄 Cover Letter Generator
A tiny Python tool that writes your cover letters so you don’t have to.  
Feed it your resume highlights + a job description → get a clean PDF cover letter.

Because applying to 50 jobs manually is a crime against humanity.

## 🚀 What It Does
- Talks to Gemini to generate a personalized cover letter  
- Wraps the text nicely into a PDF  
- Saves you time, stress, and maybe your sanity

## 🧠 How It Works
You give it:
- Your resume highlights  
- The company info  

It gives you:
- A professional cover letter that sounds like you on your best day

## ▶️ Run It
Just run the script and a PDF magically appears at your chosen path.

## 🛠️ Files
- `CLetter.py` — talks to Gemini  
- `SPDF.py` — makes the PDF  
- `main.py` — the whole pipeline  

## 🎯 Why I Built This
Because writing cover letters is the final boss of job hunting,  
and I prefer to fight bosses with Python.
